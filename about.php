			<p>
			My name is Kyle. I was born in 1993.
			I went to Durango High School graduating in 2011. I went to school at Humboldt State University for a little while.
			I participated in the HSU archery club there and had so much fun shooting targets with friends. I took a break from school
			and worked a couple jobs. I moved up to Fort Collins to finish my degree and went from Front Range Community College to
			Colorado State University. I am currently an Applied Computing Technology major and am involved in the CSU Science
			Fiction and Fantasy Club.
